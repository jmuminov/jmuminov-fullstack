        <h3 class="about">Who am I?</h3>
        <p class="about">I am friendly neighborhood Mom of two beautiful kids who was fortunate enough to be able to be able to turn my hobby and passion to cook into sort of a side-busess with which I can make other people's celebrations much more merrier.</p>
        <h3 class="about">Why Chocolate dips by Safina?</h3>
        <p class="about">My family and I put a good thought about what I should name my business, after all, the name has to be easy to read, memorible, and has to be very recognizeable, it has to be Unique. Since the main idea of the business is to sell chocolate covered products, I couldn't limit myself by naming the business Chocolate covered stawberries by Safina, the name seemed too generic, and thats how I have finalized with the current name.</p>
