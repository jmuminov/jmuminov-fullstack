1. First I will create three const valirables and name them numOne, numTwo, numThree
2. I will assign numbers to them per the assignment using the ariphmetic arguments
3. Next, I will create const variable where I would concatinate all three strings together
4. Lastly, I will use alert() method to display the concatinated strings under variable named combo
